# cve_exploit
A lightweight Python3/SQLite/Flask application designed to automatically maintain a database of CVEs which have known public exploits. The data is retrievable via a REST-like API. 
## Requirements

`pip3 install flask`

## Install

`git clone https://github.com/p4lsec/cve_exploit.git && cd cve_exploit`

Modify the port and IP address in 'app.py'
## Usage

To start the webapp:

`python3 app.py`

Once the app is running, you can perform a GET request and provide a CVE number:

`curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/cve_exploit/cve-2019-3010`
```
